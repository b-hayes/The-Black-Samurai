# The-Black-Samurai
My First attempt at making a game. It's a 2d platform game built in Unity 4 with complex key-frame animations for the player and parallax effects for the scenery.

Was for a University assignment. There are references for the artwork and music in a spreadsheed in the doccumentation folder.
